# **About Me**
## Who am I?
If you didn't catch it already, my name is _Justin Henson_ and I go to school at Univeristy of Missouri, Columbia, currently pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology.
## What I do outside of school
When I'm not doing school work I can be found working at Best Buy. I work anywhere from 2 to 5 days a week. I recently got put into a new postion at Best Buy working in the precinct of GeekSquad, where I work on client's computers and help resolve any issues people may have on their personal devices. It has been a great way for me to become more comfortable on computers and learn all kinds of new skills. I hold another job at the high school I attended, where I teach the drumline, as well as run all the sound for the group. I have been playing music for 13 years now, and I find it rewarding to be able to give back to a program that did so much for me when I was in school. Besides work, I enjoy playing disc golf with friends, making music, and spending some alone time playing games.
